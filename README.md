What I need to include:
- Draws 10+ versions of the same shape to the screen.
- Updates multiple properties of those shapes over time.
- Use conditional statement
- have the shapes interact
- have user interaction (through keyboardd or mouse)

My plan:
- Have 2 types of shapes on the screen: stars and triangles.
- Have the breathe in and out.
- The shapes are moving around the screen at the same time, and when they hit each other they bounce off? <- this might be hard to do since they have to do both conditions at the same time.
- if a key is tapped the program resets
